# DCS Syria Mission
To run:
1) Clone this repository into: `Saved Games/DCS/Scripts/`.
When you're done, you should have a folder that looks like this: `Saved Games/DCS/Scripts/syr-miz/`.
2) Comment out the `sanitizeModule` lines in `Scripts/MissionScripting.lua` in your DCS installation (ie: not `Saved Games/`) location.

Run the mission file as usual.
